# Xtudy

## Inspiration
* Andre and Nathan attended UBRI Connect this October, where they heard from an executive at Coil.
* Coil builds web enabled platforms for monetization within browsers.
* We built off of this model, emphasizing the creation of a "stream" of money.
* Tutors and tutees are a perfect model because some online education programs can lack interaction.
## What it does
* It allows tutors to host educational sessions over video chat.
* Tutees can join the session and contribute a stream of payments directly to the tutors wallet of choice.
* This allows for personal and real time interaction between students and educators.
## How we built it
* React front end provides responsive and dynamic user interactions.
* NodeJS and express webserver allows for the use of the Xpring SDK.
* Hosted on Google Cloud Platform
* Cryptocurrency transferred on the XRP Ledger
* Video Chat built on Jitsi
## Challenges we ran into
* Ripple wallets must be initialized with 20 XRP.
* Xpring is very new and has limited functionality and documentation.
* Jitsi was mainly designed to be embedded in static webpages.
* We did not have widespread experience in creating large react web apps
* This is a very new model for web monetization and it was challenging to produce a finished product.
## Accomplishments that we are proud of
* Payments flow in real time.
* Temporary wallet architecture allows for ease of use.
* Livestreams are embedded within HTML.
* Wallets can refund unused funds.
## What we learned
* The Xpring platform was released a month ago, and it was interesting to learn about how the SDK worked.
* None of us had built a web-app backend in NodeJS.
* We gained insight into brand new technologies that will affect how the internet functions.
* We learned basic React design, including how to build an effective single page application.
## What's next for Xtudy
* Incorporate tutor ratings for a self-regulating economy.
* Implement access control to allow for one-on-one and private group sessions.
* Adding a cut of monetization for the server host.
* Categories We Will Be Comp
